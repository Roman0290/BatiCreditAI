## Credit Scoring and Loan Optimization System

### Overview

Bati Bank, a leading financial service provider, has partnered with an eCommerce company to introduce a **Buy-Now-Pay-Later** (BNPL) service. This project aims to build a robust **Credit Scoring Model** to assess customer creditworthiness, predict default probabilities, and optimize loan terms.

This repository contains all the components required to:
1. Define risk categories for users (high-risk or low-risk).
2. Select observable features as predictors of credit risk.
3. Develop a model to assign risk probabilities to new customers.
4. Generate credit scores based on risk probabilities.
5. Optimize loan amounts and durations.

### Features

1. **Credit Risk Categorization**  
   Proxy variables to classify customers as high-risk or low-risk.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Selection of key predictors with high correlation to credit risk.

3. **Risk Probability Model**  
   Machine learning models to estimate the likelihood of default for a customer.

4. **Credit Scoring**  
   Conversion of risk probabilities into standardized credit scores.

5. **Loan Optimization**  
   Prediction of the optimal loan amount and duration for customers.
